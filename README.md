# Pacman 2: A-Level Programming Project
This is my OCR June 2023 A-Level Computer Science Programming Project. 

This Project was created in Unity. I have misplaced the original codebase, however, I managed to recreate the C# code and the sprites. I downloaded the sounds from `www.classicgaming.cc/classics/pac-man/sounds`.

## Running Executable
Run the `Executable/Pacman 2.exe` file. 

## How to Play
Once the game begins, a maze is randomly generated. Pacman starts with three lives. At the beginning of each round, he appears in a random position. You can control Pacman with either the arrow keys or the WASD keys on your keyboard. 

Ghosts will appear from the four corners of the maze at regular time intervals. 

Pacman and the ghosts will each be either red, blue or green. If Pacman touches a ghost of the same colour, this ghost will be eaten and you will gain 100 points. If Pacman touches a ghost of a different colour, Pacman will die and lose a life. 

The maze will contain set numbers of diamonds and energizers. Eating either will grant you 10 points. Eating an energizer will make the ghosts change colour to match Pacman and go to the corner furthest away from him temporarily.
